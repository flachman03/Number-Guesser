Number Guesser is a paired-project featuring the combined work of Ryan Flachman and Steve Rumizen. This project was done during MOD 1 for the Turing School of Software & Design Front End Engineering program, and was built using provided comps. The goal for Number Guesser was to create a fully-functional guessing game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The site was built using no provided assets beyond hex codes and comps.
